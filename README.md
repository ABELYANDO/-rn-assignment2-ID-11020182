Description
The View component is a container for the entire application screen, with a Text component displaying the message "My 
name is ABEL KWEKU YANDO". The style is defined using styles.container, styles.text, and styles.bold. 
The StatusBar component from Expo manages the status bar's appearance, setting it to "auto".
The app runs with a centered message, cyan background color, 
and bold text, with the status bar style managed automatically by the platform.
